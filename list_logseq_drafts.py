# list_logseq_drafts.py ‚Äî Draft Detection for Hugo Blog

# This script scans Markdown files in a Logseq graph and identifies which ones are drafts for a given blog
# It does so by parsing the YAML front matter block for a custom 'blog' field (e.g. blog-personal)
# Only files that match the configured blog name are printed with their metadata

from pathlib import Path  # pathlib is used for cleaner and more flexible file path handling
import yaml  # PyYAML is used to parse YAML front matter (install with: pip install pyyaml)

# ========== Configuration ==========
# Toggle verbose logging (non-critical skips, warnings)
VERBOSE = False 

# Define the blog this script is targeting
TARGET_BLOG = "blog-personal"

# Define the source directory: where your Logseq pages are located
source_dir = Path("~/Projects/logseq/knowledge-graph/pages/").expanduser()

# Define the destination folder in your Hugo blog (used for export - future capability)
target_dir = Path("~/Projects/blogs/blog-personal/content/posts/").expanduser()

# Ensure the target directory exists; if not, create it
# 'parents=True' allows creation of nested directories
# 'exist_ok=True' prevents error if the directory already exists
target_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# ========== Front Matter Extraction Function ==========
# This function extracts and parses the front matter from a Markdown file
# It returns the front matter as a dictionary (if successful) and the line index where the body begins
# If parsing fails or no valid front matter is found, it returns (None, None)
def extract_front_matter(lines):
    in_front_matter = False
    front_matter_lines = []

    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        stripped = line.strip()

        if not in_front_matter:
            if stripped == "---":
                in_front_matter = True  # Start recording front matter
                continue
            elif stripped.startswith("- ") or stripped.startswith("# "):
                # Avoid interpreting list items or headings as front matter
                break
            else:
                continue  # Ignore other lines before front matter starts

        elif stripped == "---":
            # End of front matter block
 
            # # NOTE on edge case handling (see test case 6):
            # This script intentionally does not support YAML front matter that is embedded
            # within Markdown-style bullet lists (e.g., lines like `- ---`, `- title: Foo`, etc).
            #
            # Although our parser strips leading bullet characters (`-`, `*`, etc) when scanning
            # for delimiters, lines like `- title: Foo` are still treated by PyYAML as part of
            # a list, not a mapping. This causes YAML parsing to fail, since front matter is
            # expected to be a dictionary (mapping) with key-value pairs.
            #
            # For robustness and clarity, we do not attempt to parse or normalize YAML that
            # appears to be inside a list structure. If this becomes a real-world issue,
            # one could extend the parser to:
            #   - Detect list-style front matter and try to reformat it into a mapping
            #   - Or issue a warning that such formatting is unsupported
